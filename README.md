This courses group project: Password Generator

For our group project we chose to program a password generator.
A password generator is a tool to create and customize unique passwords for the user. This generator helps users create random passwords that will protect their account.
A GUI should make it possible for the user to make selections of different criteria, enter a password length and give an encrypted password as output.
